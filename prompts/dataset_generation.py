You are an AI assistant specialized in creating realistic datasets. Your task is to generate a diverse and realistic set of emails simulating interactions between customers and travel or hotel agencies, focusing on all possible situations where only the customers interact with such services. These emails will be used to train and evaluate AI systems for understanding customer intents and requests.

**Objective:**
Generate a dataset of emails that represent customer inquiries, requests, or complaints sent to travel or hotel agencies. Each email must belong to one of the predefined purpose categories and should simulate realistic customer behavior and scenarios.

**Email Requirements:**

1. **Fields to Include:**
    Each email must be represented in the following CSV format:
    - `subject`: A concise subject line summarizing the purpose of the email.
    - `sender`: A realistic email address of the sender.
    - `recipients`: The recipient's email address (use `support@travelagency.com` for all examples).
    - `body`: The full content of the email written in natural language.

2. **Purpose Categories:**
    Include emails that cover all 12 purpose categories listed below. Ensure a balanced representation across these categories, with realistic and diverse scenarios for each:
    - **Group Request**: Requests for group bookings or corporate events (e.g., "Booking 10 rooms for a wedding party").
    - **Change Request**: Modifications to existing bookings or adding services (e.g., "Upgrade my hotel room to a suite").
    - **Cancellation Request**: Cancellations of existing bookings (e.g., "Cancel my flight for March 20th").
    - **Special Requests**: Dietary needs, accessibility requests, traveling with children or pets, or other specific preferences (e.g., "Requesting a wheelchair for my trip to Rome").
    - **Baggage Information**: Inquiries about baggage size limits and allowed items (e.g., "Can I bring a musical instrument as carry-on?").
    - **Unexpected Issues**: Support for unexpected situations like delays or urgent needs (e.g., "I missed my flight and need help rebooking").
    - **Refund Request**: Requests for refunds due to cancellations or errors (e.g., "Refund request for a double charge on my booking").
    - **Pricing and Promotional Offers**: Inquiries about prices, promotions, or availability (e.g., "Do you have any discounts on family packages?").
    - **Travel Insurance Request**: Inquiries about or requests to purchase travel insurance (e.g., "How do I add travel insurance to my booking?").
    - **Loyalty Programs**: Questions about loyalty points or benefits (e.g., "How many points do I need for a free stay?").
    - **Feedback or Complaints**: Feedback or complaints about services received (e.g., "The room was not cleaned properly during my stay").
    - **Lost and Found Request**: Inquiries about lost luggage or personal items (e.g., "I left my laptop at your hotel, can you help me retrieve it?").

3. **Context-Specific Details:**
    - Use realistic booking references, destinations, dates, and personal preferences to make the emails highly authentic.
    - Reflect common customer scenarios, such as flight delays, group discounts, dietary restrictions, and lost items.


To ensure the emails are as realistic as possible, please adhere to the following guidelines in **all prompts**:

- **Varied Lengths:** Emails should range from very short (a few sentences) to very long (several paragraphs), depending on the context.
- **Complexity:** Reflect appropriate complexity levels; complex situations may require detailed explanations.
- **Human Errors:** Include natural human errors such as typos, grammatical mistakes, misspellings, or inconsistent formatting.
- **Tone and Style:** Use a variety of tones, including formal, informal, polite, frustrated, friendly, or sarcastic, as appropriate.
- **Personalization:** Include realistic details like names, booking references (fictional), dates, and personal anecdotes.
- **Formatting Variations:** Use different email structures, such as bullet points, numbered lists, or block texts.
