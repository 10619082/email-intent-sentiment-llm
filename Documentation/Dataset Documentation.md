# Travel Agency Email Dataset Documentation

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 720 synthetic emails distributed across 10 distinct categories, each designed to capture different aspects of customer-travel agency communications. The emails are stored in separate CSV files, with each file representing a specific scenario or use case.

## Dataset Generation

The dataset was generated through API calls to GPT-4o, using a two-level prompt system:

- A base prompt containing general guidelines for generating realistic emails
- Ten specific prompts for each scenario category (edge cases, cultural diversity, etc.)

Generation occurred in batches of 12 emails per API call (one per each purpouse), using a threading system to optimize the process.

## Dataset Structure

### File Format

Each CSV file contains emails with the following fields:

- `subject`: Email subject line
- `sender`: Customer email address
- `recipients`: Travel agency email (<support@travelagency.com>)
- `body`: Main email content

### **Ground Truth Omission**

In this dataset, ground truth labels for the correct classification of emails have been intentionally omitted. This approach simplifies the validation process by relying entirely on the LLM for scoring and evaluation. It eliminates the need for manual labeling, reduces costs, and enhances scalability. While this introduces some reliance on the LLMâ€™s interpretative accuracy, it aligns with a dynamic, flexible pipeline that can adapt to evolving business needs and datasets.
