"Assistance Needed with Overdue Refund";"kelly.johnson@example.com";"refunds@travelagency.com";"Dear Refunds Team,

I am writing to follow up on a refund request I submitted over a month ago regarding my canceled trip (booking reference T12345). I was informed that the refund would be processed within 14 business days, but I have yet to receive the funds or any communication regarding the delay.

This situation is causing me financial strain, and I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of responsiveness. Please provide an update on the status of my refund and expedite the process.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Request for Travel Itinerary Correction";"bruce.banner@example.com";"changes@travelagency.com";"Hello,

I recently received my travel itinerary for booking reference U67890, and I noticed that my surname is misspelled as 'Baner' instead of 'Banner'. It's important that this be corrected to match my passport to avoid any issues at the airport.

Please update my booking with the correct spelling and send me the revised itinerary.

Thank you.

Best regards,

"Complaint About Unhelpful Staff at Check-In";"tony.stark@example.com";"feedback@travelagency.com";"To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received at the check-in counter on November 1st, 2023, at CityT Airport. The staff member was unhelpful and rude when I asked for assistance with my luggage.

This experience has left a negative impression of your airline. I expect better customer service and hope you will address this issue internally.
